# Flagsmith with React and OpenFeature

## Setup

To set up your local environment, first copy `.env.example` to `.env` and
populate your Flagsmith environment ID. Optionally, specify the API endpoint
that you want to use to retrieve the value of your feature flags.

> Note: if you attempt to run the development environment without populating the
> `.env` file correctly, you will encounter an error in the terminal.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run `npm start` to run the app in the
development mode.

This should attempt to open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to
view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the
console.

## OpenFeature

Please refer to the OpenFeature
Documentation](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/technologies/client/web/react)
for further information.
