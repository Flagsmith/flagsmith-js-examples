# Flagsmith with Plasmic

## How it works

Here we combine Flagsmith Feature flags with Plasmic pages.

When Plasmic compiles pages we check whether we have a remote config for that url, if we do we render that page instead.

Based on the following, we render /homev2 when visiting /:

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to see the result.

You can start editing your project in Plasmic Studio. The page auto-updates as you edit the project.
